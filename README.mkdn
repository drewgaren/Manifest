Getting Started
---------------
This will allow you to build CM10 for The HTC FLYER... 

Warning this is still a work in progress. To test compiling you can try from my repo and or submit new patches to me.

    repo init -u git://github.com/drewgaren/manifest.git -b JB

Then to sync up:

    repo sync


This is still a work in Progress. Please submit any Flyer Patches via repo or email.

Latest Builds will be hosted at DrewGaren.com

Thanks to Dexter for the current Kernel for JB.
